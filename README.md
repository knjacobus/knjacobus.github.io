# The Beginning of Vaccines #

**A Historical Timeline of the Development of Early Impactful Vaccines for our Society's Health:**

The development of immunization was really discovered by accident. However, because of the danger of certain diseases in the 1700s, people, especially mothers, were willing to let their children be the subjects of early vaccination in hopes that the vaccine would protect their kids. Now, vaccinations have improved the overall health of society and come close to eradicating diseases like polio, small pox and measles.

# Progress and Areas of Improvement of Immunization Rates amongst Different Age Groups of the United States #

**United States Child Influenza Vaccination Rates between 2010-2015:**

In the United States (US) flu vaccination for children is still remarkably low given the known risks and danger flu season poses to young kids. However, with a push in education and urgency in public health, flu vaccination rates in children are continuously increasing. According the the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), vaccination rates have rose from 43% to 59.3% since 2010. While these statistics are encouraging, vaccination rates still need to increase to ensure the utmost protection against the flu for both children and adults.

**2006-2016 Influenza Vaccination Coverage by Age Group in the United States**

This chart shows the national coverage of influenza vaccination of adults in three different age groups over a span of 10 years. As you will see in the data, the age group of 18-49 years old consistently has the lowest percentage of individuals vaccinated each year. I think there could be a lot done on college campuses to improve this statistic for influenza vaccination and protection.

# Easy Ways to Improve the Health and Protection of your Local Community #

**5 closeset places for Lehigh Students to get a Flu Shot**

This map shows the five closest places that Lehigh students can easily go to and get a flu shot during flu season. Whether students walk, uber or drive themselves to these locations, it is critical that our student body takes the initiative to get vaccinated. In doing so, they will not only be protecting themselves, but most importantly be protecting their friends, peers, professors and co-workers that come in contact with them on a daily basis.

# Impact of Disease and Immunization around the World #

**Vaccine-preventable diseases and their effect on the world today**

Depending on where one lives, vaccine-preventable diseases are still extremely prevalent around the globe. In the following graphs, it is illustrated which vaccine-preventable diseases have caused have the most impact on the world, which diseases have declined in their prevalance the most, and which diseases have seen little to no change in reported cases and deaths since 1990. Lastly, it is shown in the final bar graph that certain countries are undeniably struggling with these preventable diseases more than others. It is important to understand the following data and begin strategizing ways to get education, medical care and vaccines to those in need in other parts of the world.
