In the United States (US) flu vaccination for children is still remarkably low given the known risks and danger flu season poses to young kids. However, with a push in education and urgency in public health, flu vaccination rates in children are continuously increasing. According the the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), vaccination rates have rose from 43% to 59.3% since 2010. While these statistics are encouraging, vaccination rates still need to increase to ensure the utmost protection against the flu for both children and adults.

This chart shows the national coverage of influenza vaccination of adults in three different age groups over a span of 10 years. As you will see in the data, the age group of 18-49 years old consistently has the lowest percentage of individuals vaccinated each year. I think there could be a lot done on college campuses to improve this statistic for influenza vaccination and protection.
